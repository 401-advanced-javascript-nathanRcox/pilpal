# PilPal App

## Author: Nathan Cox, Ashley Moore & Dina Ayoub

## Summary

1. Name: PilPal
2. Function: medication tracker
3. A mobile app that makes tracking your medications and whether you’ve taken them or not easy and, therefore, more effective.

## Pain point

1. Because remembering to take your meds or which meds you’ve taken isn’t always easy or straightforward, making tracking that easier means tracking it likely.
2. Because skipping a day or taking a pill more often than prescribed can be dangerous, an easy, reliable way to track them is invaluable.
3. The ability to track symptoms along with meds can translate into the correlation of the two and data-based adjustments. (Stretch goal: graphs, data analysis, etc.)

## MVP

1. Add new meds
	1. Name
	2. Dosage
	3. Frequency
	4. Time of day
2. Tracker: Have you taken it or not
	1. Pill-specific
	2. Day-specific
3. Database data persistence
4. Authentication

## Stretch Goals

1. Reminders
2. Add an as-needed med (e.g., anxiety meds)
3. Additional users or patients
4. ACL
5. Identify the pill by photograph and add it that way
