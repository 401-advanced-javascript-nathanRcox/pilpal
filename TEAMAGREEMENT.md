# 401 Final: Team Agreement

Nathan Cox, Ashley Moore, Dina Ayoub

## Communication plan

### How will your group communicate with each other?

* Written communication will be in Slack.
* We will meet virtually in Remo to start, but will switch to Zoom if need be.
* Scheduled Hours: 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. PST in Remo with breaks throughout the day. No one is expected to work outside these hours.
* While all team members are happy to help wherever and whenever they can, requests for help should be made without the expectation that the help will be immediate.

### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to?

* Daily standup at 9:00 am where we take turns and each person shares out to the group:
	* where we’re struggling, any new successes, etc.
	* each person will have a turn to speak;
	* we will hold each other accountable to make sure each person gets to speak;
	* “What can I work on today to be a better teammate?”

### Do you have a plan for managing psychological safety?

We plan to adhere to the below code of ethics:

#### /Code of Ethics/

* There are no dumb questions.
* We are all here to help and support each other.
* Giving and receiving honest feedback is critical to our success as a group.
* Putting the team first: be willing to take on extra if needed and lean on others when you need help. We will succeed as a team.
* Respect one another.
* If you have conflict, communicate about it in a respectful way. Listen first.
* Teammates should self-advocate when they need a break or help.

## Conflict plan

### What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What will your process be to resolve it?

* Recognizing that a point of conflict lies in the team’s failure to manage expectations, the following
	* The team’s collaboration and learning is more important to the team than the final project itself.
	* Working as team is more likely going to mean pair- and mob-programming than working individually.
	* Knowing this, we can choose a project that will be fun, interesting, and pretty without being overly complicated or involved.
* In our morning meeting, we can address conflict as a group. The other group members will take on the role of mediation. When talking about conflict, we will use “I” words instead of “you,” e.g., “I feel. . . .”
* If someone feels triggered, we will take a 15 minute break and then come back together to discuss (using “I” words) to try and move past the issue. We will be sure to give each person a voice in that conversation (by a moderator).
* If we feel like someone else is not pulling their weight or if someone is dominating the group:
	* Make this part of our daily meetings, i.e., each person reports on their workload.
	* Ensure everyone is willing to give and receive honest feedback about their contributions.
	* Tone and delivery of feedback is key.

## Work plan

### How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

* We will identify tasks by creating to-do lists and assigning tasks so that each group member gains experience with each aspect of the project. We will talk through tasks in our daily meetings and update the group as new tasks/challenges arise.

* Give everyone a mix of solo work and pair- and mob-programming.

### In particular, make sure you know how you’ll track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the application, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. What project management tool will be used?

* We will use Trello and ensure it is up-to-date, utilized, and readable by an outside party. Our Trello board will give our current project status.

## Git process

### What is your Git flow?

* We will create a main branch, and a development branch and then branch off the development branch. Merge onto main for core MVP and final MVP.
* Naming conventions for branches? “name/feature” or “featureName/name”
* How many people must review a PR?
Two approvals for any PRs to main; one approval for PRs to dev. We will formalize this through GitHub.
* Who merges PRs?
Any team members may merge PRs, but in the event of merge conflicts, the developer most familiar with the code should manage the merge.
* How often will you merge?
We will merge onto the development branch immediately after getting working code. We’ll merge onto the main branch daily.
* How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
The developer will let the entire group know it’s time to merge via Remo or through Slack.
_Anything else you feel is important: expectations around work times, stand-up times(outside of the ones schedule with the instructional team), taking breaks/seeking help when you’re stuck, etc._
* Take breaks, including a 30-minute daily lunch break.
* Drink water
